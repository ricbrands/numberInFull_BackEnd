This is an API project to return the number in full.

There are two end-points:

-> /pt/:number

This will return the number in full in portuguese.

For development you will need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environment.

## TODO
Still missing to implement the tests and the validations (sanitization) of data.
